----

This repository houses some proof-of-concept work generateing synthetic HiRISE imagery with [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2/).

These synthetic images could be used to supplement training datasets for classifiers like PlaNet, or as test images for automated guidance systems like Terrain-Relative Navigation.

The [examples folder](https://github.com/TimNagle-McNaughton/synthetic_mars/tree/main/poly_examples) contains random pairings of real and fake images taken from the full mosaics.
